# StimulusResponse

Analysis of electrical stimulus (intracortical microstimulation) responses of single units. Data was collected using the Neural Interface Processor from Ripple Neuro with Utah arrays in the motor cortex of non-human primates. 

Manuscript in preparation.

Example short-term excitatory response followed by long-term inhibitory response due to single-pulse intracortical microstimulation. The excitatory response was quantified by the probability that a stimulus elicits a spike, and the inhibitory response by the time it takes until the next spontaneous spike.
