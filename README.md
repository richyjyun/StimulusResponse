# StimulusResponse ([bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.30.486457v1))

Analysis of electrical stimulus (intracortical microstimulation) responses of single units. Data was collected using the Neural Interface Processor from Ripple Neuro with Utah arrays in the motor cortex of non-human primates. 

Example short-term excitatory response followed by long-term inhibitory response due to single-pulse intracortical microstimulation. The excitatory response was quantified by the probability that a stimulus elicits a spike, and the inhibitory response by the time it takes until the next spontaneous spike.

We tracked the changes in responses over time due to repetitive stimulation, their dependence on spontaneous firing rates and firing patterns, and the relationship between the excitatory and inhibitory responses.
